The wavetrend introduction video can be used also inside the website.
When you play the video please don't use windows media player, the windows video app
and playing it with linux video works fine, only windows media player somehow
showed the video slightly shaky, it can be my setup idk.
There are two types of screenshots: Light Theme and Dark Theme exists as shown in the video too.
